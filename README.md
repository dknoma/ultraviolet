#Welcome

Ultra Violet is a 2D side-scrolling platform game developed for my HCI 2018 project. It studied how developing a game with biofeedback input could augment traditional controls and increase player enjoyment.

This game was developed in Unity using C#. The various biofeedback signals used were facial expression/emotion tracking via the Affectiva Affdex SDK (https://knowledge.affectiva.com/v3.2/docs/getting-started-with-the-emotion-sdk-for-unity) and eye tracking via Tobii Unity SDK (https://developer.tobii.com/tobii-unity-sdk/). To use facial expression tracking any web cam will work, but for eye tracking only Tobii eye trackers will work with the SDK. This project only contains the scripts and some assets for the game as github has a filesize limit of 100 MB.
